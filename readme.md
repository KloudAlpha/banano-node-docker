## **Description**

**Install a Banano node on your server with a vast variety of tools in a couple of minutes!** üí´

<table>
	<tr>
        <th>Note</th>
    </tr>
    	<tr>
        <td>
        For hosting a Banano node in the <a href="https://beta.nano.org/" target="_blank">BETA network</a>, checkout the "<a href="https://github.com/lephleg/nano-node-docker/tree/beta"><b>beta</b></a>" branch.
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

This project will build and deploy the following containers on your Docker host:

<table>
	<tr>
		<th width="200px">Container name</th>
		<th>Description</th>
 	</tr>
 	<tr>
   <td><b>banano-node</b></td>
   		<td>The Banano node created out of the official <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/bananocoin/banano" target="_blank">Banano Docker Image</a>. RPC is enabled but <u>not</u> publicly exposed. (Renamed to "<i>banano-beta-node</i>" for BETA)</td>
 	</tr>
	<tr>
  		<td><b>banano-node-monitor</b></td>
   		<td>The popular Banano Node Monitor PHP application based on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/nanotools/nanonodemonitor/" target="_blank">NanoTools's Docker image</a>.</td>
 	</tr>
	<tr>
  		<td><b>watchtower</b></td>
   		<td>A process watching all the other containers and automatically applying any updates to their base image. No need to manually upgrade your node anymore.</td>
 	</tr>
</table>

### **SSL Support with Let's Encrypt**

Optionally, if a domain name is available for your host, Banano Node Docker can also serve your monitor securely using HTTPS. If this feature is enabled (using the `-d` argument with the installer), the stack will also include the following containers:

<table>
	<tr>
		<th width="220px">Container name</th>
		<th>Description</th>
 	</tr>
 	<tr>
   <td><b>nginx-proxy</b></td>
   		<td>An instance of the popular Nginx web server running in a reverse proxy setup. Handles the traffic and serves as a gateway to your host.</td>
 	</tr>
	<tr>
  		<td><b>nginx-proxy-letsencrypt</b></td>
   		<td>A lightweight companion container for the nginx-proxy. It allows the creation/renewal of Let's Encrypt certificates automatically.</td>
 	</tr>
</table>

## **Quick Start**

Download or clone the latest release, open a bash terminal and fire up the installation script:

```
$ cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/amamel/banano-node-docker.git && cd ~/banano-node-docker
$ sudo ./setup.sh -s
```

**That's it!** You can now navigate to your host IP to check your Banano Node Monitor dashboard. **Do not forget to write down** your wallet seed as it appears in the output of the installer.

### Available command flags/arguments

The following flags are available when running the stack installer:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th width="20px">Flag</th>
        <th width="180px">Argument</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>-d</b></td>
        <td>your domain name</td>
        <td>Sets the domain name to be used. Required for SSL-enabled setups.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>-e</b></td>
        <td>your email address</td>
        <td>Sets your email for Let's Encrypt certificate notifications. Optional for SSL-enabled setups.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>-f</b></td>
        <td>-</td>
        <td>Enables fast-syncing by fetching the latest ledger and placing it into <i>/root/Nano/</i> inside <b>banano-node</b>
            container.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>-q</b></td>
        <td>-</td>
        <td>Quiet mode. Hides any output.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>-s</b></td>
        <td>-</td>
        <td>Prints the unecrypted seed of the node wallet during the setup (<b>WARNING:</b> in most cases you may want to avoid this
            for security purposes).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>-t</b></td>
        <td>Docker image tag</td>
        <td>Indicates the preferred tag for the nanocurrency Docker image. Defaults to "latest". Optional.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

### Banano Node CLI bash alias

Banano node runs inside the banano-node container. In order to execute commands from its [Command Line Interface](https://docs.nano.org/commands/command-line-interface/) you'll have to enter the container or execute them by using the following Docker command:

```
$ docker exec -it banano-node banano_node <command>
```

For convinience the following shorthand alias is set by the installer:

```
$ banano-node <command>
```

Both of the above formats are interchangeable.

## Examples

### **Install with SSL enabled**

After your DNS records are setup, fire up the installation script with the domain (-d) argument:

```
$ sudo ./setup.sh -d mydomain.com -e myemail@example.com
```

The email (-e) argument is optional and would used by Let's Encrypt to warn you of impeding certificate expiration.

**Done!** Navigate to your domain name to check your Banano Node Monitor Dashboard over HTTPS!

### Install with fast-syncing

Banano Node Docker stack can also bootstrap any newly created node (or an existing one) with the latest ledger files. This implies that you are willing to trust third-party sources for your node history. The latest ledger files are obtained from the Banano Foundation's Yandex [disk](https://yadi.sk/d/fcZgyES73Jzj5T) while My Nano Ninja [API](https://mynano.ninja/api) handles the extraction and final redirect.

Just add the `-f` flag to your installer command:

```
$ sudo ./setup.sh -f
```
**WARNING: You are strongly advised to BACKUP your wallet seed before trying to fast-sync an existing node.**

### **Install with a different Banano node image**

Want to install a specific Banano node image for testing? Add a tag -t and you can easily specify a specific Banano node version:

```
$ sudo ./setup.sh -t v22-experimental2
```

### **Combining installer flags**

All the installer flags can be chained, so you can easily combine them like this:

```
$ sudo ./setup.sh -sfd mydomain.com -e myemail@example.com
```

(_display seed, apply fast-sync and use Let's Encrypt with your email supplied_)
